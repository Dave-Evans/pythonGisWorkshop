String types can be thought of as a type consisting of letters or other characters that will be printed out to read by a human.

      "Hmmm, what happened?  A `string literal`? What we haven't told you is that Python uses the backslash as an escape character. It looks like Python put an extra backslash in our path and there should be a slash showing that our Dane county file is in the `county_files` folder. Python was constructed to use only forward slashs (`/`) in file paths. The backslash (`\\\\`) is a character that tells Python not to evaluate that character as it normally would, this is referred to as an escape character or escaping certain characters. Suffice it to say that Python wants to see a forward slash in file paths and Windows used backslashs. What Python has done is to automatically add a *second* backslash in the string object, telling itself that it is really a backslash, it is atually *escaping* the backslash. (If we were to use the `print` function on this string value, we would not see the double backslashing because `print` is making a pretty output for us to read, try `\"\\t a tab\"` and then `print \"\\t a tab\"` to see the difference. The `\\t` is a tab, here we are escaping the 't' to mean not a real 't', but a tab.)\n",

      "Back to our example, the double backslashes here mean that Python understands we mean to separate the directories from each other but its interpreting the `\\\"` as if we're saying, don't look at those double quotes as ending or closing our string. Its good practice to take steps to make sure that Python will correctly read these strings as file paths. One could use only forward slashes when working with Python (this could be an issue if you are writing commands to be passed to the Windows command shell) or use an \"`r`\" before the file path, this tells Python to interpret this as a raw strings, e.g., r\"C:\\gis_data\\county_files\". These steps ensure that our file paths are read correctly. \n",

      " * Think of an **object** as a generic **container** for data and functionality. The data and functionality contained within an object can be accessed using dot notation.  The notation follows the hierarchy of the embedded content. For example, given a variable `var`, you can access an embedded object using a dot followed by the object name, `var.object`. These hierarchies can have any number of nested objects (e.g., `var.object1.object2.object3`).\n",

      "print(myint.imag)\t#There is no imaginary portion of the number\n",
      "```\n",
      "* Let's compare them to some Methods you've already seen.  Remember, unlike objects, methods are followed by parentheses ().  \n",

Now that you have your new Toolbox you can create a script tool by rt-clicking your new toolbox, and click **Add > Script**.

While ESRI has been building better bindings with Python, Python has been building better analytical tools such as [numpy](http://www.numpy.org/), [scipy](http://www.scipy.org/), [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/), and my personal favorite although it's not included in the ArcGIS distribution of Python, [pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/). Although I don't expect many of you to fully understand the following code completely, I thought I'd add it to the end of the module to give you a simple example of how you can combine ArcGIS with Python's emerging analytical tools."
